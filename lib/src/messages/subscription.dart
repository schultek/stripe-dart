  /// invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an active state. If the first
  /// invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to
  /// incomplete_expired. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be
  /// voided and no further invoices will be generated.
  ///
  /// A subscription that is currently in a trial period is trialing and moves
  /// to active when the trial period is over.
  ///
  /// If subscription collection_method=charge_automatically it becomes past_due
  /// when payment to renew it fails and canceled or unpaid (depending on your
  /// subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry
  /// attempts.
  ///
  /// If subscription collection_method=send_invoice it becomes past_due when
  /// its invoice is not paid by the due date, and canceled or unpaid if it is
  /// still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a
  /// subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent invoices will be
  /// attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically
  /// closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you
  /// may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
